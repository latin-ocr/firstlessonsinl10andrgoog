This sentence consists of four propositionsss l. Thi
. me miseret, Ι pity you. 2. Aiebat testurhni lacerta,
said a lizard to atortoise. 3. Quo tuam ipsa tecum‘
ferre cogaris domum, who are compelled to carry your
. house with you. 4. Quoiunquc libeat vadere, whither·
soever it pleases (you) to go. ,
These propositione arc to hc analyzed and parsed
like the preceding, hut in the first, the subject is want-
ing, and in the fourth, it consists of the infinitivo vadere.
. The impersonal verb miseret is here translated in such
amanner that the prononn me, depending upon it, ap-
pears in English as its subject, instead of the pronoun
it. It might, though less properly, have been trans-
lated, “it pities.” The other impersonal verbs men·
tioned in 401 are usually translated in the same manner.
